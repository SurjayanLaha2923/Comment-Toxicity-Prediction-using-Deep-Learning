# Comment-Toxicity-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
"Welcome to my project on building a Comment Toxicity Prediction Model! In today's digital age, online harassment and toxic comments have become a major concern. 
As a responsible AI enthusiast, I want to contribute to creating a safer online environment. In this project, I'll be using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques 
to develop a machine learning model that can detect and predict toxic comments. From data preprocessing to model deployment, I'll take you through every step of the process. 
Let's dive in and explore how we can use AI to promote kindness and respect online!"
